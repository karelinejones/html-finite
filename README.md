--Introduction
 my game Alterstar makes you a space ranger tasked with getting carinaes heart. there are a couple of things on your journey that you will have to decide what to choose. whatever you choose will determine your fate.

--framework
so for this i used html and css for styling. i had the differerent choices be hyperlinks and depending on which one you chose uou would be taken to a certain html. for the background becuase i wanted them to each have their own backgrounds i did those in their own html files
for the pictures i used:

first scene - https://openclipart.org/detail/303305/space-station plus canva tools
second scene - https://openclipart.org/detail/172504/space-sketched plus canva tools
third scene - https://openclipart.org/detail/16867/above-earth-in-space plus canva tools
fourth scene - picture of eta carinae and canva effects

--running
i made this on .vscode to run this on there you would need the extention live server.

--switching between
i used hyperlinks to create the choices and then whatever one the user chooses it will take them to the next state

--learned
i just started working with html this school year so i got a lot more practice with it as well as more styling machanics. plus getting all of the different html files connected through the hyperlinks

--proud of 
i am proud of the background because i had a really hard time trying to make it fit and not be multiple times on the screen. and i think they are cute

--need to work on
i wished i could have got into more of the styling of the program but i just ran out of time
